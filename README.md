- **Security**: Comprehensive security implementation with CSP and CSRF protection

## Security Implementation

This application implements enterprise-grade security following industry best practices:

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

Our CSP implementation follows the methodology outlined in `csp.md`:

- **Dynamic Nonce-Based CSP**: Uses cryptographically secure nonces generated per request
- **Environment-Aware Policies**: Strict CSP in production, relaxed in development
- **Middleware-Based**: CSP headers are set via Next.js middleware for optimal performance
- **Following Best Practices**: Implements the exact approach recommended in the csp.md guide

#### CSP Implementation Details:

1. **Nonce Generation**: Uses `crypto.randomUUID()` converted to base64 (following csp.md)
2. **Development vs Production**:
   - **Development**: Includes `'unsafe-eval'` for hot-reloading
   - **Production**: Strict nonce-based policy with `'strict-dynamic'`
3. **Header Management**: All security headers handled by middleware
4. **Violation Reporting**: CSP violations are logged to `/api/security/csp-report`

### CSRF Protection

- **Token-Based Protection**: Cryptographically secure tokens for all state-changing operations
- **Multiple Storage**: Tokens stored in secure cookies with backup mechanisms
- **Server Action Integration**: Automatic CSRF validation for all server actions
- **API Route Protection**: Middleware-level CSRF validation for API endpoints

### Rate Limiting

- **Redis-Backed**: Uses Redis for distributed rate limiting (fallback to in-memory)
- **Endpoint-Specific**: Different limits for auth, uploads, API calls, etc.
- **Environment-Aware**: Stricter limits in production

### Additional Security Features

- **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Security Headers**: Full set of security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **Audit Logging**: Security events logged for monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without information disclosure

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis (optional, for rate limiting)
- Supabase account

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd promptexify
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp env.template .env.local
   # Fill in your environment variables
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   npm run db:push
   ```

5. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Environment Variables

See `env.template` for all required environment variables including:

- Database connection (PostgreSQL)
- Supabase configuration
- Redis URL (optional)
- AWS S3 credentials (for file uploads)
- Other service configurations

### Security Development

When working with security features:

1. **CSP Development**: Use localhost for relaxed CSP, non-localhost for strict CSP testing
2. **CSRF Testing**: All forms automatically include CSRF tokens via the `useCSRF` hook
3. **Rate Limiting**: Test with different client identifiers to verify limits
4. **Security Headers**: Check browser dev tools to verify headers are set correctly

### Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run db:migrate` - Run database migrations
- `npm run db:studio` - Open Prisma Studio
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run csp:analyze` - Analyze CSP violations (custom script)

## Architecture

### Security Architecture

```
Request → Middleware → CSP Headers + CSRF Validation → Route Handler
          ↓
          Rate Limiting + Security Logging
```
