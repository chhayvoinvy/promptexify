# Medical Research and Clinical Analysis

Apply Gemini's analytical capabilities to medical research, clinical trials, and healthcare data analysis.

## Clinical Research Design

### Study Methodology

Design rigorous clinical studies with:

1. Patient population definition and inclusion criteria
2. Primary and secondary endpoint identification
3. Statistical power and sample size calculations
4. Randomization and blinding protocols
5. Data collection and monitoring procedures
6. Safety assessment and adverse event reporting

### Regulatory Compliance

Ensure adherence to:

- FDA guidelines and regulations
- Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards
- Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements
- Data integrity and audit trails
- Patient privacy and confidentiality

## Data Analysis

### Biostatistical Methods
