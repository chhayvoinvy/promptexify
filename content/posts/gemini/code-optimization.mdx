# Code Optimization Strategies

Harness Gemini's analytical power to identify performance bottlenecks and improve code quality across multiple programming languages.

## The Optimization Framework

### Performance Analysis Prompt

Review this code and provide:

1. Time complexity analysis
2. Space complexity evaluation
3. Performance bottleneck identification
4. Memory usage optimization suggestions
5. Algorithm improvement recommendations
6. Scalability assessment for large datasets

### Code Quality Assessment

Analyze for:

- Code readability and maintainability
- Design pattern implementation
- Error handling robustness
- Testing coverage gaps
- Documentation completeness
- Security vulnerability assessment

## Language-Specific Optimizations

### Python Performance

```python
# Before: Inefficient list operations
def slow_function(data):
    result = []
    for item in data:
        if item > 0:
            result.append(item * 2)
    return result

# After: List comprehension optimization
def fast_function(data):
    return [item * 2 for item in data if item > 0]
```

### JavaScript Optimization

Focus on:

- Async/await best practices
- Event loop understanding
- Memory leak prevention
- Bundle size optimization
- DOM manipulation efficiency

### Database Query Enhancement

- Index optimization strategies
- Query execution plan analysis
- N+1 problem resolution
- Caching layer implementation
- Connection pooling efficiency

## Advanced Techniques

### Algorithmic Improvements

- Data structure selection optimization
- Sorting algorithm efficiency analysis
- Search operation enhancement
- Recursive vs. iterative approaches
- Dynamic programming applications

### Architecture Optimization

- Microservices design patterns
- Load balancing strategies
- Caching mechanisms
- API design efficiency
- System scalability planning

## Monitoring and Profiling

Request analysis for:

- CPU usage patterns
- Memory allocation tracking
- I/O operation optimization
- Network latency reduction
- Error rate minimization
