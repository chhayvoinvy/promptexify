-- SECURITY NOTES
-- =============================================
/*
IMPORTANT SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:

1. SUPABASE BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED:
   - Single consolidated policy per table to avoid multiple permissive policies
   - Explicit role targeting with TO clause (authenticated, anon)
   - Helper functions for complex logic (is_admin(), has_premium_access())
   - Consistent naming convention for policies
   - Minimal required permissions granted
   - Optimized indexes by removing unused/redundant ones
   - Uses CASE statements for operation-specific logic within single policies

2. AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION:
   - Uses Supabase Auth with auth.uid() for user identification
   - Role-based access control (ADMIN role for privileged operations)
   - Premium subscription validation with expiration checks
   - Author ownership validation for content management

3. DATA ACCESS PATTERNS:
   - Public data: Categories, Tags, Views, Favorites (read-only)
   - User-specific data: Bookmarks, Logs (own data only)
   - Content access: Posts with premium/public/author-based restrictions
   - Admin access: Full control over all resources

4. SECURITY FEATURES:
   - Featured posts are admin-only (cannot be modified by authors)
   - Premium content requires active subscription
   - View tracking works for anonymous users
   - Audit logs track user actions
   - Helper functions prevent code duplication and improve maintainability

TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Test with different user roles (admin, premium, free, anonymous)
2. Verify premium content access with expired subscriptions
3. Test bookmark/favorite creation for inaccessible posts
4. Ensure view tracking works for both authenticated and anonymous users
5. Verify audit logs are properly restricted
6. Test featured posts functionality (admin-only access)
7. Verify authors cannot change featured status of their posts
8. Test policy performance with large datasets

MONITORING:

1. Monitor RLS policy performance with slow query logs
2. Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE on queries to check policy overhead
3. Monitor helper function performance (is_admin, has_premium_access)
4. Regularly audit user permissions and access patterns
5. Monitor for policy conflicts or unexpected access patterns
6. Track subscription validation performance

-- OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
-- =============================================
/*
FIXES APPLIED:

1. MULTIPLE PERMISSIVE POLICIES RESOLVED:
   ✅ Categories: Consolidated 2 policies into 1 using CASE statement
   ✅ Tags: Consolidated 2 policies into 1 using CASE statement
   ✅ All tables now have single policy per table to avoid conflicts

2. POLICY CONFLICT ERRORS FIXED:
   ✅ Added missing DROP POLICY IF EXISTS statements for all new policies
   ✅ Script is now idempotent and safe to run multiple times
   ✅ Prevents "policy already exists" errors (ERROR 42710)

3. UNUSED INDEXES REMOVED:
   ✅ Tag_createdAt_desc_idx - Rarely used for tag queries
   ✅ View_ipAddress_idx - Covered by composite indexes
   ✅ View_ipAddress_createdAt_desc_idx - Redundant with existing indexes

4. INDEXES OPTIMIZED:
   ✅ Added Category_name_idx for unique constraint performance
   ✅ Added Tag_name_idx for unique constraint performance
   ✅ Kept only essential indexes that are actively used

5. PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
   ✅ Reduced policy evaluation overhead
   ✅ Eliminated index maintenance overhead for unused indexes
   ✅ Improved query planning with optimized index set
   ✅ Script execution is now faster and more reliable

6. RLS WARNINGS FIXED:
   ✅ Added policies for _PostToTag table (Prisma many-to-many relation)
   ✅ Added policies for _prisma_migrations table (system table)
   ✅ Optimized auth function calls by wrapping in subqueries (SELECT is_admin())
   ✅ Fixed performance warnings for categories and tags policies
   ✅ All auth functions now use subquery pattern for better performance

7. RLS PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
   ✅ Fixed categories policy: wrapped is_admin() in double subquery for optimal performance
   ✅ Fixed tags policy: wrapped is_admin() in double subquery for optimal performance
   ✅ Eliminated re-evaluation of auth functions for each row at scale

8. MULTIPLE PERMISSIVE POLICIES RESOLVED:
   ✅ _PostToTag: Consolidated SELECT and ALL policies into single access policy
   ✅ _prisma_migrations: Consolidated SELECT and ALL policies into single access policy
   ✅ Eliminated policy conflicts for authenticated role SELECT actions
